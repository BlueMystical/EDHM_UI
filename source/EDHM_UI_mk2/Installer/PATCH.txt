✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.2.51 ✦✦ is now available.  
Change Log:
- Fix Supercharged Jump Lines that could sometimes display noise.
- Fix an issue where the number of unread messages was still displayed when the on-foot HUD was disabled in stations (w121).
- The option to hide the Dot inside stations (w109) no longer requires hiding the rest of the on-foot HUD in stations.

✦ NEW: the HUD Elements on Station Concourse option (w121) now has a new mode: Minimalist. This allows you to hide the on-foot HUD inside stations while keeping the active Insight Hub bar visible (where you can see unread messages, for example). (image 1)

✦ We got several reports of virus infection in the installer, we believe it was an attack on Github files, this patch should be clean, thank you for your patience and apologies for the inconvenience.

✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.2.39 ✦✦ is now available.  
Change Log:
- Fix for FDev Update 18.07
- Fix Some Orange
- Fixe Orbit Lines

⚠️ FDev U18.07 Update has made changes to Orbit Lines, making them thicker to reduce the hatching effect.

Due to these changes, the Thick Orbit Lines Mod no longer works, and an update will be necessary when it becomes available.

Unfortunately, FDev has introduced a bug that causes Orbit Lines to not always be hidden correctly when disabled in-game (some visible lines on the screen when attempting to disable them are not hidden and start moving).
The solution is to disable the lines when they are not visible, such as when in normal flight.

Until FDev fixes this issue, I offer you a temporary 3PMod that allows you to use a keyboard shortcut to enable/disable the Orbit Lines Shader, which will effectively hide them without encountering this problem. ➡️ #3rd-party-mods

- Small update to fix some minor issues introduced in FDev Update 14.02

- Fixed Galmap textures that broke in FDev 14.02

- Added colour options for Damaged Stations on GalMap (previously was only Custom)

- Converted most 'Thargoid effects on Station' icons on the Targeting Panel (Lower left)
    Note: I have to fly around to capture each combination of station type and thargoid status, and sometimes there's more than one version (I currently have about 25 versions)
    If you see an orange (unmodded) Thargoid status symbol on the station icon can you please let me know:
        - the system and station name (or just a screenshot)
        - your game resolution
    Note: I haven't done the versions above 1440p (inclusive of supersampling), will update as I find them (no need to report these hi-res versions)

- Added an option to choose the colour for the Combat Zone (CZ) panels (top right Info Panel)
    Note: This colour will also affect the background of the Thargoid frame on the Targeting Panel (bottom left)
    Will also affect the target ship's subcomponents bar

- Fixed a glitch on some Concourse Terminal Monitors. Please let me know if the fix breaks anything

Change Log:

- Minor bug fixes on the 3PMods.
- Introducing the Enhanced Biome Overlay (EBO) for Odyssey & Horizons 4.0

The default overlay has a background of blue, and a biome target colour of slightly more greeny-blue - it's not surprising it can be very difficult to distinguish between the two layers, especially for CMDRs with visual difficulties.

EBO is a 3P Mod (a Plugin) for EDHM, therefore you need to Download it independently:

Download:  https://discord.com/channels/773552741632180224/897503811944460388/1029702569209102387
Install Instructions:
- Exit the Game.
- Download the ZIP file and save it anywhere you want.
- In the EDHM_UI go to 'Main Menu -> 3PMods'
- At the bottom toolbar, click 'Import Mod' and select the ZIP you downloaded.

- Fixes Post FDev 4.0 update, EDHM v13.4 implemented.
- Bunch of Oranges got juiced, thanks to @CMDR Fred89210 
- Added new options for Space Dust, look for it under Global Settings, (your current Global Settings need to be overwritten, sorry for that).

EXCELLENT NEWS FOR ALL HORIZON PLAYERS:
```
- With Horizons 4.0, you now have access to all of the EDHM customization options, previously you only had a tiny piece of the pie.
- All you need to do is configure the game paths correctly, to do so open the EDHM Settings and click the green button, that's it!
- In 'Odyssey' or 'Horizons 4.0' mode, you can now choose ANY color for almost any HUD element.
- You will also have more than 120 custom themes created by our talented community.
```
✦✦ Unfortunately, the old Horizons themes are NOT compatible with the new mode,
     take it as an opportunity to try something new ^_^

We welcome our new Horizons 4.0 brethren into the real EDHM! Time to take the red pill 😉  
We look forward to seeing what sort of amazing HUDs you create.

Change Log:

- EDHM v13.3 ODYSSEY implemented.

- Thanks to @CMDR Fred89210 for his first shader mod! You can now change the colour of the Supercruise Snow to custom, multi-colour, or XML.
  ✦ You can find SC Snow under 'Global Settings' in the UI, this is an User's prefference not affected by themes.

- Added a 'face fix' for the darkened skin tone in Odyssey. The fix adds brightness to the skin tone only while in-ship.
  ✦ You can find this in the Cabin Lighting section

- Fixed orange icons in Foot Comms
- Added fail-safe for Altitude Bar text for old themes where brightness is missing
- Fixed an edge-case bug with the panel background/shadows and shield percentage

✦ Added an Option in the UI Settings to Automatically apply theme in the game by Focusing it and sending the F11 key, 
  This behaviour may be a bit 'intrusive' therefore it is OFF by default.

✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.1.30 ✦✦ is now available.  
Change Log:
- Fix for FDV Update 13, Part 3 (The Final Punch)

@psychicEgg:
Here's the third and final round of major fixes for FDev Update 13 🎉 
This update turned out to be the most disruptive with 39 of the 50 modded shaders requiring updating or replacement. I'd say this would have something to do with the merging of Horizons as many of the affected shaders hadn't been updated by FDev in over a year
If you spot any orange please let me know in #edhm-mod and I'll take care of it.

I hope you enjoy the update!

✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.1.9.4 ✦✦ is now available.
Change Log:
- EDHM, v11.11 (Odyssey) implemented.
  ✦ Night Vision / PWA fixed
  ✦ Overhaul of Team ship bar
  ✦ New rank badge on FHUD targets now take XML colour (was orange)
  ✦ FHUD team shield colour set to default (was contaminated by XML)
  ✦ Nav panel contacts tab, colour of Team contact bar set to default (blue), was contaminated by XML
  ✦ Team member out of system icon modded

  ✦ Fixed a few orange multicrew icons (may still be some remaining, I couldn't do extensive tests)
  ✦ Landing Coaster Fixed
  ✦ Landing Hologram fixed
  ✦ Radar planet terrain fixed
  ✦ Carrier terminal on Command deck fixed (the Shipyard terminals may not be fixed, I don't have a shipyard module on my carrier to test. I'll need some help with this)
  ✦ Privacy Mode terminal fixed
  ✦ Intro screens on Concourse Terminals should look a bit better in general (note: when the game first loads it uses a really low res placeholder texture for the terminal screen, which is orange. Then it is replaced by the normal one after everything loads)

  ✦ Bunch of orange icons fixed

  ✦ Fix for space fog / nebulae turning off in External Camera mode when FSS background brightness is set to 0 
  ✦ Please note: Your FSS/DSS main reticle colour will be applied to the External Camera side lines. We can't avoid this as it's part of the same resource used in the FSS/DSS
  ✦ set the default FSS/DSS mode to Elite default (z118 = 200), so old themes won't be FSS/DSS green by default

  ✦ Ship's Name Color and Background.
  ✦ Options for Color Protection: Yellow, White, Green, Red, Cyan
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ** Colour Protection **
 The mod protects certain default Elite colours to add variety to the panel and
 interactive screens (otherwise they all become coloured with your XML)
 You can override colour protection below.

 Please note: This version of EDHM was designed with colour protection, so it's
 recommended you leave this setting ON (or possibly remove the bright yellows)

 This is a new experimental feature, and if you spot any glitches please let me know
 Some icons aren't colour protected, they just aren't modded
