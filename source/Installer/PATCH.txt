✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.1.48 ✦✦ is now available.  
Change Log:

- Minor bug fixes on the 3PMods.
- Introducing the Enhanced Biome Overlay (EBO) for Odyssey & Horizons 4.0

The default overlay has a background of blue, and a biome target colour of slightly more greeny-blue - it's not surprising it can be very difficult to distinguish between the two layers, especially for CMDRs with visual difficulties.

EBO is a 3P Mod (a Plugin) for EDHM, therefore you need to Download it independently:

Download:  https://discord.com/channels/773552741632180224/897503811944460388/1029702569209102387
Install Instructions:
- Exit the Game.
- Download the ZIP file and save it anywhere you want.
- In the EDHM_UI go to 'Main Menu -> 3PMods'
- At the bottom toolbar, click 'Import Mod' and select the ZIP you downloaded.

✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.1.44 ✦✦ is now available.  
Change Log:

- Added a new Feature called 'User Settings'.
  This can store any UI element you want.
  Unlike Global Settings, user settings are saved in your 'My Documents' directory and will never be overwritten by any Update nor patch.
  Global Preferences will always be overridden from now on, or at least every time we need to add new settings in there.

  ✦ Global Settings have priority over theme settings.
  ✦ User Settings have priority over Global settings.

This is a new feature, any feedback and bug reports are welcome at #edhm-ui.

✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.1.36 ✦✦ is now available.  
Change Log:

- Fixes Post FDev 4.0 update, EDHM v13.4 implemented.
- Bunch of Oranges got juiced, thanks to @CMDR Fred89210 
- Added new options for Space Dust, look for it under Global Settings, (your current Global Settings need to be overwritten, sorry for that).

EXCELLENT NEWS FOR ALL HORIZON PLAYERS:
```
- With Horizons 4.0, you now have access to all of the EDHM customization options, previously you only had a tiny piece of the pie.
- All you need to do is configure the game paths correctly, to do so open the EDHM Settings and click the green button, that's it!
- In 'Odyssey' or 'Horizons 4.0' mode, you can now choose ANY color for almost any HUD element.
- You will also have more than 120 custom themes created by our talented community.
```
✦✦ Unfortunately, the old Horizons themes are NOT compatible with the new mode,
     take it as an opportunity to try something new ^_^

We welcome our new Horizons 4.0 brethren into the real EDHM! Time to take the red pill 😉  
We look forward to seeing what sort of amazing HUDs you create.

✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.1.32 ✦✦ is now available.  
Change Log:

- EDHM v13.3 ODYSSEY implemented.

- Thanks to @CMDR Fred89210 for his first shader mod! You can now change the colour of the Supercruise Snow to custom, multi-colour, or XML.
  ✦ You can find SC Snow under 'Global Settings' in the UI, this is an User's prefference not affected by themes.

- Added a 'face fix' for the darkened skin tone in Odyssey. The fix adds brightness to the skin tone only while in-ship.
  ✦ You can find this in the Cabin Lighting section

- Fixed orange icons in Foot Comms
- Added fail-safe for Altitude Bar text for old themes where brightness is missing
- Fixed an edge-case bug with the panel background/shadows and shield percentage

✦ Added an Option in the UI Settings to Automatically apply theme in the game by Focusing it and sending the F11 key, 
  This behaviour may be a bit 'intrusive' therefore it is OFF by default.

✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.1.30 ✦✦ is now available.  
Change Log:
- Fix for FDV Update 13, Part 3 (The Final Punch)

@psychicEgg:
Here's the third and final round of major fixes for FDev Update 13 🎉 
This update turned out to be the most disruptive with 39 of the 50 modded shaders requiring updating or replacement. I'd say this would have something to do with the merging of Horizons as many of the affected shaders hadn't been updated by FDev in over a year
If you spot any orange please let me know in #edhm-mod and I'll take care of it.

I hope you enjoy the update!

@everyone ✦✦ EDHM_UI v2.1.6 ✦✦ is now available.
Change Log:
- Fixed a bug with the Shipyard.
- EDHM v10.1 for Odyssey had been implemented. 
  ✦ Ship's Name Color and Background.
  ✦ Options for Color Protection: Yellow, White, Green, Red, Cyan
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ** Colour Protection **
 The mod protects certain default Elite colours to add variety to the panel and
 interactive screens (otherwise they all become coloured with your XML)
 You can override colour protection below.

 Please note: This version of EDHM was designed with colour protection, so it's
 recommended you leave this setting ON (or possibly remove the bright yellows)

 This is a new experimental feature, and if you spot any glitches please let me know
 Some icons aren't colour protected, they just aren't modded
