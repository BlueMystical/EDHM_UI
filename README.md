![EDHM_UI Preview](static/preview.jpg)

## What is EDHM_UI?

EDHM_UI is the user interface for the Elite Dangerous mod [EDHM](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM).
The purpose of EDHM is to allow players of the game to customize their HUD Colors in many ways.
This is estrictly a graphical mod, we dont change any in-game mechanics or things that FDev charges for.

Current features include:

* Allowing the user to change all of the mods current options using a simple
  graphical interface.
* Bundled with the latest EDHM version - no need to install EDHM separately.
* Bundled with lots of pre-made, community-contributed themes.
* Fully compatible with both Horizons and Odyssey!
* Translated to 6 languages: EN, RU, DE, FR, IT, PT.

## Requirements

EDHM_UI requires Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.52 or newer. If you are on
Windows 10, you may already have it. If you don't have it installed yet, you.
can get it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452).

## Installation

* Download the latest `EDHM_UI_Setup.msi` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases/latest).

## First-Run Setup

The first time EDHM_UI runs, it will prompt you for the Elite Dangerous game
folder. This determines where the EDHM core mod will be installed. The location
varies depending on which version of ED you have installed. Simply click the Green Button and do as the Assistant says.
